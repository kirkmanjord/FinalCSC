You must download the csv from the kaggle dataset to run the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores
When using our sql server use these queries instead of importing csv (note that this is a mySQL server that has to be turned on to be accessed):
SELECT
    personId,
    height
FROM players;

SELECT
    ps.personId,
    p.firstName,
    p.lastName,
    ps.gameId,
    g.gameDate,
    l.gameDateTimeEst,
    l.gameSubtype,
    th.teamName AS playerTeamName,
    CASE
        WHEN g.hometeamId = ps.teamId THEN 'home'
        WHEN g.awayteamId = ps.teamId THEN 'away'
        ELSE 'unknown'
    END AS home_away,
    ps.numMinutes,
    ps.points,
    ps.assists,
    ps.blocks,
    ps.steals,
    ps.fieldGoalsAttempted,
    ps.fieldGoalsMade,
    ps.fieldGoalsPercentage,
